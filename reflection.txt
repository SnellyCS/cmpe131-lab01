The main thing branches allows is for multiple software engineers work on the same project without interfering with other peoples code. Try to work in the same work space can cause many difficulties as changes are being made. It is also a generally better practice to work in different files to be able to isolate things better so if a bug arises or code is still not finished, it can be located or excluded will still in the process of being fix/finallized.
